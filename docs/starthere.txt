THIS IS NOT A README AND WILL BE GOING AWAY
This is the krap shoot brain. 
Right now we need to fill in the package.xml files with the information ROS needs to launch each as a node. 
See initializer/project.xml for example. This example needs work as we get code built.
We also need to fill in the motors.yaml and sensors.yaml with information about motors and sensors.
Each package will also need it's cmakelists.txt file filled. 
This is important to build each package regardless of whether or not it uses python or c.
These are the build instructions, from the krapshoot directory. Change {OS SUFFIX} to .sh, .bash. or .zsh for your OS:
    conda activate ros_env
    colcon build --simlink-install
    source install/setup.{OS SUFFIX}
    ros2 launch robot_bringup robot.launch.py
